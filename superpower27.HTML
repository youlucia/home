		<h1>My Superpower</h1>
		<h2>What is it ?</h2>
		<p>My superpower is control water. So that means I can separate different debris from water, I also can make a bubble full of air or gathered air in water so I can stay in water for a long time, I don&rsquo;t need to worry about water pressure so I can dive very deep. I don&rsquo;t need to swim, I just need to control water to push me.</p>
		<h2>How I get it ?</h2>
		<p>One day I drink some unknown liquid, when I realize something goes wrong, it was too late. After that I sick for days, and I found I got the power of control water. I never tell this to anyone yet, I know my power is dangerous. So I move to an island.</p>
		<h2>What I do with it ?</h2>
		<p>Now I live near a beach, save people who is drowning. I don't want others know I have superpower because I know it will course me trouble. I like my power but it completely change my life. Now I hide my power and live like others, but I never stop worry about if others know my secret.</p>
